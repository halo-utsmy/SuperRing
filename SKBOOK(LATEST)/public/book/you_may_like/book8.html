<h1>A Little Journey</h1>

<hr class="chap">
<p class="ph3">She'd paid good money to see the inevitable ...<br>
and then had to work to make it happen!</p>
<hr class="chap">
<p>There were two important things—one, that she was very old; two, that
Mr. Thirkell was taking her to God. For hadn't he patted her hand and
said: "Mrs. Bellowes, we'll take off into space in my rocket, and go
to find Him together."</p>
<p>And that was how it was going to be. Oh, this wasn't like any other
group Mrs. Bellowes had ever joined. In her fervor to light a path for
her delicate, tottering feet, she had struck matches down dark alleys,
and found her way to Hindu mystics who floated their flickering, starry
eyelashes over crystal balls. She had walked on the meadow paths with
ascetic Indian philosophers imported by daughters-in-spirit of Madame
Blavatsky. She had made pilgrimages to California's stucco jungles
to hunt the astrological seer in his natural habitat. She had even
consented to signing away the rights to one of her homes in order to be
taken into the shouting order of a temple of amazing evangelists who
had promised her golden smoke, crystal fire, and the great soft hand of
God coming to bear her home.</p>
<hr class="chap">
<div class="figcenter">
<img alt="" height="500" src="images/illus.jpg" width="400" id="img_images_illus.jpg">
</div>
<hr class="chap">
<p>None of these people had ever shaken Mrs. Bellowes' faith, even when
she saw them sirened away in a black wagon in the night, or discovered
their pictures, bleak and unromantic, in the morning tabloids. The
world had roughed them up and locked them away because they knew too
much, that was all.</p>
<p>And then, two weeks ago, she had seen Mr. Thirkell's advertisement in
New York City:</p>
<p class="ph3">COME TO MARS!</p>
<p class="ph4">Stay at the Thirkell Restorium for one week. And then,<br>
on into space on the greatest adventure life can offer!</p>
<p class="ph4">Send for Free Pamphlet: "Nearer My God To Thee."</p>
<p class="ph4">Excursion rates. Round trip slightly lower.</p>
<p>"Round trip," Mrs. Bellowes had thought. "But who would come back after
seeing <i>Him</i>?"</p>
<p>And so she had bought a ticket and flown off to Mars and spent seven
mild days at Mr. Thirkell's Restorium, the building with the sign on it
which flashed: THIRKELL'S ROCKET TO HEAVEN! She had spent the
week bathing in limpid waters and erasing the care from her tiny bones,
and now she was fidgeting, ready to be loaded into Mr. Thirkell's own
special private rocket, like a bullet, to be fired on out into space
beyond Jupiter and Saturn and Pluto. And thus—who could deny it?—you
would be getting nearer and nearer to the Lord. How wonderful! Couldn't
you just <i>feel</i> Him drawing near? Couldn't you just sense His breath,
His scrutiny, His Presence?</p>
<p>"Here I am," said Mrs. Bellowes, "an ancient rickety elevator, ready to
go up the shaft. God need only press the button."</p>
<p>Now, on the seventh day, as she minced up the steps of the Restorium, a
number of small doubts assailed her.</p>
<p>"For one thing," she said aloud to no one, "it isn't quite the land of
milk and honey here on Mars that they said it would be. My room is like
a cell, the swimming pool is really quite inadequate, and, besides, how
many widows who look like mushrooms or skeletons want to swim? And,
finally, the whole Restorium smells of boiled cabbage and tennis shoes!"</p>
<p>She opened the front door and let it slam, somewhat irritably.</p>
<p>She was amazed at the other women in the auditorium. It was like
wandering in a carnival mirror-maze, coming again and again upon
yourself—the same floury face, the same chicken hands, and jingling
bracelets. One after another of the images of herself floated before
her. She put out her hand, but it wasn't a mirror; it was another lady
shaking her fingers and saying:</p>
<p>"We're waiting for Mr. Thirkell. <i>Sh!</i>"</p>
<p>"Ah," whispered everyone.</p>
<p>The velvet curtains parted.</p>
<p>Mr. Thirkell appeared, fantastically serene, his Egyptian eyes upon
everyone. But there was something, nevertheless, in his appearance
which made one expect him to call "Hi!" while fuzzy dogs jumped over
his legs, through his hooped arms, and over his back. Then, dogs and
all, he should dance with a dazzling piano-keyboard smile off into the
wings.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bellowes, with a secret part of her mind which she constantly had
to grip tightly, expected to hear a cheap Chinese gong sound when Mr.
Thirkell entered. His large liquid dark eyes were so improbable that
one of the old ladies had facetiously claimed she saw a mosquito cloud
hovering over them as they did around summer rain-barrels. And Mrs.
Bellowes sometimes caught the scent of the theatrical mothball and the
smell of calliope steam on his sharply pressed suit.</p>
<p>But with the same savage rationalization that had greeted all other
disappointments in her rickety life, she bit at the suspicion and
whispered, "This time it's <i>real</i>. This time it'll work. Haven't we got
a <i>rocket</i>?"</p>
<p>Mr. Thirkell bowed. He smiled a sudden Comedy Mask smile. The old
ladies looked in at his epiglottis and sensed chaos there.</p>
<p>Before he even began to speak, Mrs. Bellowes saw him picking up each of
his words, oiling it, making sure it ran smooth on its rails. Her heart
squeezed in like a tiny fist, and she gritted her porcelain teeth.</p>
<p>"Friends," said Mr. Thirkell, and you could hear the frost snap in the
hearts of the entire assemblage.</p>
<p>"No!" said Mrs. Bellowes ahead of time. She could hear the bad news
rushing at her, and herself tied to the track while the immense black
wheels threatened and the whistle screamed, helpless.</p>
<p>"There will be a slight delay," said Mr. Thirkell.</p>
<p>In the next instant, Mr. Thirkell might have cried, or been tempted to
cry, "Ladies, be seated!" in minstrel-fashion, for the ladies had come
up at him from their chairs, protesting and trembling.</p>
<p>"Not a very long delay." Mr. Thirkell put up his hands to pat the air.</p>
<p>"How long?"</p>
<p>"Only a week."</p>
<p>"A week!"</p>
<p>"Yes. You can stay here at the Restorium for seven more days, can't
you? A little delay won't matter, will it, in the end? You've waited a
lifetime. Only a few more days."</p>
<p><i>At twenty dollars a day</i>, thought Mrs. Bellowes, coldly.</p>
<p>"What's the trouble?" a woman cried.</p>
<p>"A legal difficulty," said Mr. Thirkell.</p>
<p>"We've a rocket, haven't we?"</p>
<p>"Well, ye-ess."</p>
<p>"But I've been here a whole month, waiting," said one old lady.
"Delays, delays!"</p>
<p>"That's right," said everyone.</p>
<p>"Ladies, ladies," murmured Mr. Thirkell, smiling serenely.</p>
<p>"We want to see the rocket!" It was Mrs. Bellowes forging ahead,
alone, brandishing her fist like a toy hammer.</p>
<p>Mr. Thirkell looked into the old ladies' eyes, a missionary among
albino cannibals.</p>
<p>"Well, now," he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, <i>now</i>!" cried Mrs. Bellowes.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid—" he began.</p>
<p>"So am I!" she said. "That's why we want to see the ship!"</p>
<p>"No, no, now, Mrs.—" He snapped his fingers for her name.</p>
<p>"Bellowes!" she cried. She was a small container, but now all the
seething pressures that had been built up over long years came
steaming through the delicate vents of her body. Her cheeks became
incandescent. With a wail that was like a melancholy factory whistle,
Mrs. Bellowes ran forward and hung to him, almost by her teeth, like a
summer-maddened Spitz. She would not and never could let go, until he
died, and the other women followed, jumping and yapping like a pound
let loose on its trainer, the same one who had petted them and to whom
they had squirmed and whined joyfully an hour before, now milling about
him, creasing his sleeves and frightening the Egyptian serenity from
his gaze.</p>
<p>"This way!" cried Mrs. Bellowes, feeling like Madame Lafarge. "Through
the back! We've waited long enough to see the ship. Every day he's put
us off, every day we've waited, now let's see."</p>
<p>"No, no, ladies!" cried Mr. Thirkell, leaping about.</p>
<p>They burst through the back of the stage and out a door, like a flood,
bearing the poor man with them into a shed, and then out, quite
suddenly, into an abandoned gymnasium.</p>
<p>"There it is!" said someone. "The rocket."</p>
<p>And then a silence fell that was terrible to entertain.</p>
<p>There was the rocket.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bellowes looked at it and her hands sagged away from Mr.
Thirkell's collar.</p>
<p>The rocket was something like a battered copper pot. There were a
thousand bulges and rents and rusty pipes and dirty vents on and in it.
The ports were clouded over with dust, resembling the eyes of a blind
hog.</p>
<p>Everyone wailed a little sighing wail.</p>
<p>"Is that the rocket ship <i>Glory Be to the Highest</i>?" cried Mrs.
Bellowes, appalled.</p>
<p>Mr. Thirkell nodded and looked at his feet.</p>
<p>"For which we paid out our one thousand dollars apiece and came all the
way to Mars to get on board with you and go off to find Him?" asked
Mrs. Bellowes.</p>
<p>"Why, that isn't worth a sack of dried peas," said Mrs. Bellowes.</p>
<p>"It's nothing but junk!"</p>
<p><i>Junk</i>, whispered everyone, getting hysterical.</p>
<p>"Don't let him get away!"</p>
<p>Mr. Thirkell tried to break and run, but a thousand possum traps closed
on him from every side. He withered.</p>
<p>Everybody walked around in circles like blind mice. There was a
confusion and a weeping that lasted for five minutes as they went over
and touched the Rocket, the Dented Kettle, the Rusty Container for
God's Children.</p>
<p>"Well," said Mrs. Bellowes. She stepped up into the askew doorway of
the rocket and faced everyone. "It looks as if a terrible thing has
been done to us," she said. "I haven't any money to go back home to
Earth and I've too much pride to go to the Government and tell them
a common man like this has fooled us out of our life's savings. I
don't know how you feel about it, all of you, but the reason all of us
came is because I'm eighty-five, and you're eighty-nine, and you're
seventy-eight, and all of us are nudging on toward a hundred, and
there's nothing on Earth for us, and it doesn't appear there's anything
on Mars either. We all expected not to breathe much more air or crochet
many more doilies or we'd never have come here. So what I have to
propose is a simple thing—to take a chance."</p>
<p>She reached out and touched the rusted hulk of the rocket.</p>
<p>"This is <i>our</i> rocket. We paid for our trip. And we're going to <i>take</i>
our trip!"</p>
<p>Everyone rustled and stood on tiptoes and opened an astonished mouth.</p>
<p>Mr. Thirkell began to cry. He did it quite easily and very effectively.</p>
<p>"We're going to get in this ship," said Mrs. Bellowes, ignoring him.
"And we're going to take off to where we were going."</p>
<p>Mr. Thirkell stopped crying long enough to say, "But it was all a fake.
I don't know anything about space. He's not out there, anyway. I lied.
I don't know where He is, and I couldn't find Him if I wanted to. And
you were fools to ever take my word on it."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Bellowes, "we were fools. I'll go along on that. But
you can't blame us, for we're old, and it was a lovely, good and fine
idea, one of the loveliest ideas in the world. Oh, we didn't really
fool ourselves that we could get nearer to Him physically. It was the
gentle, mad dream of old people, the kind of thing you hold onto for a
few minutes a day, even though you know it's not true. So, all of you
who want to go, you follow me in the ship."</p>
<p>"But you can't go!" said Mr. Thirkell. "You haven't got a navigator.
And that ship's a ruin!"</p>
<p>"You," said Mrs. Bellowes, "will be the navigator."</p>
<p>She stepped into the ship, and after a moment, the other old ladies
pressed forward. Mr. Thirkell, windmilling his arms frantically,
was nevertheless pressed through the port, and in a minute the door
slammed shut. Mr. Thirkell was strapped into the navigator's seat, with
everyone talking at once and holding him down. The special helmets
were issued to be fitted over every gray or white head to supply extra
oxygen in case of a leakage in the ship's hull, and at long last the
hour had come and Mrs. Bellowes stood behind Mr. Thirkell and said,
"We're ready, sir."</p>
<p>He said nothing. He pleaded with them silently, using his great, dark,
wet eyes, but Mrs. Bellowes shook her head and pointed to the control.</p>
<p>"Takeoff," agreed Mr. Thirkell morosely, and pulled a switch.</p>
<p>Everybody fell. The rocket went up from the planet Mars in a great
fiery glide, with the noise of an entire kitchen thrown down an
elevator shaft, with a sound of pots and pans and kettles and fires
boiling and stews bubbling, with a smell of burned incense and
rubber and sulphur, with a color of yellow fire, and a ribbon of red
stretching below them, and all the old women singing and holding
to each other, and Mrs. Bellowes crawling upright in the sighing,
straining, trembling ship.</p>
<p>"Head for space, Mr. Thirkell."</p>
<p>"It can't last," said Mr. Thirkell, sadly. "This ship can't last. It
will—"</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>The rocket exploded.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bellowes felt herself lifted and thrown about dizzily, like a
doll. She heard the great screamings and saw the flashes of bodies
sailing by her in fragments of metal and powdery light.</p>
<p>"Help, help!" cried Mr. Thirkell, far away, on a small radio beam.</p>
<p>The ship disintegrated into a million parts, and the old ladies,
all one hundred of them, were flung straight on ahead with the same
velocity as the ship.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Thirkell, for some reason of trajectory, perhaps, he had
been blown out the other side of the ship. Mrs. Bellowes saw him
falling separate and away from them, screaming, screaming.</p>
<p><i>There goes Mr. Thirkell</i>, thought Mrs. Bellowes.</p>
<p>And she knew where he was going. He was going to be burned and roasted
and broiled good, but very good.</p>
<p>Mr. Thirkell was falling down into the Sun.</p>
<p><i>And here we are</i>, thought Mrs. Bellowes. <i>Here we are, going on out,
and out, and out.</i></p>
<p>There was hardly a sense of motion at all, but she knew that she was
traveling at fifty thousand miles an hour and would continue to travel
at that speed for an eternity, until....</p>
<p>She saw the other women swinging all about her in their own
trajectories, a few minutes of oxygen left to each of them in their
helmets, and each was looking up to where they were going.</p>
<p><i>Of course</i>, thought Mrs. Bellowes. <i>Out into space. Out and out, and
the darkness like a great church, and the stars like candles, and in
spite of everything, Mr. Thirkell, the rocket, and the dishonesty, we
are going toward the Lord.</i></p>
<p>And there, yes, <i>there</i>, as she fell on and on, coming toward her,
she could almost discern the outline now, coming toward her was His
mighty golden hand, reaching down to hold her and comfort her like a
frightened sparrow....</p>
<p>"I'm Mrs. Amelia Bellowes," she said quietly, in her best company
voice. "I'm from the planet Earth."</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.

1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

</div><div>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
